# Note
The example here is slightly messier than it really should be, and doesn't follow all the best ways we've now figured out to work with neural CDEs. We recommend instead looking at [torchcde](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde), and in particular the examples of torchcde, for the best ways to do things.
